# ShoppingCart
This is a simple CLI based java program where we can specify the product, quantity and price per unit. Then we can ask the user to input the product which they need. This then gets added to the cart. The stock in the warehouse decreases depending upon the quantity taken by customer. Then it finally shows the cart items and the total price.
